# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Repo
This repo is to hold all the scripts and files for the "Getting and Cleaning DAta Course in Coursera project. 
# Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. For the project purpose the data used is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# Summary of the project:
An R script called run_analysis.R is created that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Additional information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
